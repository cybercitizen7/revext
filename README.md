Revext is a simple tool that converts browser Extension IDs into Extension name.

###### Purpose
Discovery of browser extensions is interesting because the extensions are often vulnerable to known exploits.
However, Google Chrome extensions are stored locally on endpoints with Extension ID (weird string). 
This tool will help you convert that ID to extension name. 

###### Plans
What is planned:
* Add support for other popular browser extensions
* Fetch more information about the installed extension
* Expand the tools capabilities to show known vulnerabilities for extension
