# Revext

Revext is a simple tool that converts browser Extension IDs into Extension name.

Currently it only supports conversion for Google Chrome Extensions.

###### Purpose
Discovery of browser extensions is interesting because the extensions are often vulnerable to known exploits.
However, Google Chrome extensions are stored locally on endpoints with Extension ID (weird string). 
This tool will help you convert that ID to extension name. 

This tool assumes that the extensions are installed on default path.

###### Plans
What is planned:
* Add support for other popular browser extensions
* Fetch more information about the installed extension
* Expand the tools capabilities to show known vulnerabilities for extension
